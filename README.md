# Radiation Belt Electrons – Van Allen Probes (RBSP)

This project analyses energetic electron measurements in the outer Van Allen belt using data from the RBSP-A satellite.  
It uses the RBSP and RBSPenergy files to:
- plot the time evolution of electron flux for different energy channels,
- study how the flux depends on L-shell (L*) and local time (MLT),
- compare low- and high-energy electrons during quiet and disturbed periods,
- build energy spectra and fit power-law models before, during, and after a geomagnetic storm.

The goal is to understand how the energy spectrum and intensity of radiation belt electrons change over the different phases of a geomagnetic storm.
